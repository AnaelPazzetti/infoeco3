# InfoEco - Cooperative Management App
Infoeco is an app built by IFRS-Erechim students enrolled as interns in the extension project "Creation of an organizational app for recycling cooperatives."

InfoEco is a comprehensive Flutter application designed to manage the operations of recycling cooperatives. It provides a platform for communication and data management between City Halls (Prefeituras), Cooperatives (Cooperativas), and their members (Cooperados). The app facilitates tracking of collected materials, attendance, financial distributions, and more, with a role-based access system to ensure relevance for each user type.

## üóÑÔ∏è Firestore Database Schema

The database is structured hierarchically to represent the relationships between entities. A top-level `users` collection is used for fast role lookups on login.
Although it's a simple DB structure and not the most performant, considering the system will be used by a low pre-defined number of people (a maximum of 200 people and only around 5 of them won't be cooperators), this ensures the necessary performance since the most intensive feature used will be the relationship between a cooperator and its cooperative.
